			<div>Leading global asset management company Northern Trust (Nasdaq: NTRS) has announced that audit firms can now access fund data stored on a private equity Blockchain to audit specific events in real time, according to a March 19 press release.
Northern Trust launched the first commercial implementation of Blockchain technology for private equity on Feb. 21, which allowed a limited number of clients to manage ownership shares on a transparent Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) platform. Now audit firms can have their own Blockchain node, managing access to relevant fund data that enables real-time audit capabilities, says Northern Trust.
The most recent development was made in partnership with PwC to provide instant access to a secure “golden copy” of private equity lifecycle events. According to the press release, this will improve the efficiency of the auditing process by making the underlying transactions more transparent to audit firms.
